# basic-codeplayer
A basic codeplayer for coding HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Output is automatically updated as code is entered!
The CodePlayer consists of 4 sections:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- OUTPUT

Each section can be toggled on or off.
This shows off some basic HTML, CSS styling skills, with some Javscripting skills.
NOTE: This is not a particularly safe method, as it may be possible for hackers to inject js code on to the server.
